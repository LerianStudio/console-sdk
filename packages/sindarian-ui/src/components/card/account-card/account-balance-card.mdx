# AccountBalanceCard

This card variation is specifically used to represent an individual account within the platform. It's a piece used in the Transfer pattern, but it can also be used individually, as long as it's in the correct template.

It has two styles: Single, which should be used when the account is displayed as a single account (e.g., Simple Transaction 1:1), and List, in which the account can appear within a list (Complex Transaction n:n).

# EntityCard

This is the most modular and robust variation of the Card, designed for use in entity listings.

Consider that it functions as a three-dimensional representation of a datatable row. Therefore, the same information that is usually arranged in columns would be organized here within its content.

This way, this card can be modified and customized to better accommodate each type of entity to be listed, in addition to supporting additional actions, as is typical in a datatable row.

This version of the card also has hover behavior, meaning that interaction with the card should be noticeable to the user through the addition of a raised effect (shadow).
